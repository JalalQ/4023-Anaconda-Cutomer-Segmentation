# Introduction

The objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation, and customer classifiction for the dataset **BathSoapHousehold.csv** dataset. A short description of the meaning of the variables in the dataset is given in the Variable-Description file.

I used the Anaconda Jupyter notebook (Python) to perform my predictive analysis. A print-out of the Jupyter notebook in the pdf format has also been attached for easy viewing. The major steps of my analysis are as follow:
- [x] Data Inspection. Understanding the meaning of each of the variable fields.
- [x] Data Cleaning
- [x] Variable Reduction
  * Using Correlation
  * Eploratory Data Analysis
  * Variance
- [x] Data Normalization
- [x] Principal Component Analysis (PCS)
- [x] Perform k-means clustering to perform segmentation
- [x] Customer classification model based on Logistic Regression

After performing the analysis, a summary of the key steps and result was summarized in the .pptx file.
